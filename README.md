# Code for Scientific Computing

This repo features samples of code I've developed to solve a variety of problems in scientific computing and numerical analysis. Here, you'll find code for numerical optimization problems, iterative computing, ODE and PDE solvers, matrix solvers, algorithms to solve eigenvalue problems, nonlinear and linear least squares, QR factorization, continuous function approximations, calculation of orthogonal polynomials, divide and conquer problems, polynomial interpolation, line search problems, hyperparameter tuning, and more (actually, that might cover everything.). I've also included some files which contain accompanying experiments to test how certain method's fare on different problem instances.

Special thanks to Professors Xiantao Li and Qingguo Hong (Penn State University) for all their help in teaching me about numerical analysis. Much of this code is either inspired by or based on their teachings.
